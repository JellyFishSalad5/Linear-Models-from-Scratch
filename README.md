# Linear-Models-from-Scratch
Implementation of linear regression models (1D, multivariate, stepwise) from scratch using NumPy
This mini-project implements **three types of linear regression models** completely from scratch using **NumPy only** — without relying on libraries such as scikit-learn.  
It demonstrates an understanding of mathematical modeling, gradient descent, and optimization applied in machine learning.
