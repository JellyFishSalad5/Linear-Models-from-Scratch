# Linear-Models-from-Scratch

This mini-project implements **three types of linear regression models** completely from scratch using **NumPy only** — without relying on libraries such as scikit-learn.  
It demonstrates an understanding of mathematical modeling, gradient descent, and optimization applied in machine learning.
